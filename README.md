Artistry Gallery

Artistry Gallery is a static front‑end website showcasing art collections and creative work with sections like About, Gallery, Artwork, Exhibition, FAQs, and Contact.

This is a modern, clean portfolio‑style site deployed on Netlify, perfect for demonstrating HTML/CSS skills and art presentation.
